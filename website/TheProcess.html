			<p>	&emsp;Bill Game was created to be a "serious game." Serious games are games designed to teach the user something at the
			completion of the game. Bill Game teaches the player how scripting languages work and how language trees work. We plan to create a 2-dimensional, serious puzzle-platforming game that will be both fun and educational. The game will consist of puzzle platforming sections, as well as puzzles that must be solved by an in-game actor that will be scripted by the player.
			</p>
			<p>&emsp;When the project first began the plan was to use the coding language Python with an OpenGL wrapper known as Pyglet to allow us to build the game. The website that would be connected with the game would be made with HTML and use PHP for database scripting and would have had a Drag and Drop level builder made from JavaScript. We used GitHub as a repository for our code to synchronize our work and act as a version control.
			</p>
			
			<p>&emsp;As the project went on the team had to closely examine the likely hood of developing and turning in a product made from Python at the end of the semester. After much debate and counsel from the Computer Science 490 Professor the team decided to stop working in Python and move to HTML5. HTML5 would allow us to effectively do the same thing but in a much more simple way.
			</p>
			
			<p>&emsp;HTML5's canvas tag provides a place that can be efficiently drawn to with JavaScript, which allows for games and other interactive apps to be created using only HTML5 and JavaScript. JavaScript is used to create and run the level builder and to make the website experience as a whole smoother and more user-friendly. We also wrote the game primarily in JavaScript. JavaScript itself presents certain challenges in maintaining good object oriented programming practices, but RequireJS solves these problems.
