-------------------GIT CHEAT SHEET----------------------------------------------
This guide assumes you have git properly installed and are using either git
bash or git integrated with your normal command line.

-----GETTING OUR PROJECT FROM GITHUB-----
Pick a directory where you want to store the project and type:
    
    git clone https://github.com/ABitTooCalm/-ducking-octo-shame.git path/to/directory
    
This will set up our project at the path specified on your computer. Any time
you want to use git with our project you should navigate your git terminal to
this directory.

-----GETTING THE MOST RECENT VERSION OF THE PROJECT-----
The clone command from github will have automagically set the necessary settings
to allow you to update the project.

Every time you start work on the project, you should first get the most up to
date version of the project from github by using:

    git pull
    
Once this operation is complete, your version of the project will be up to date
and you can get to work.

-----COMMITTING YOUR CHANGES TO GIT-----
In order to save your changes to the git version history on your machine, first
add any new files to version control by doing:

    git add file
    
In order to finalize the commit type:

    git commit -a -m "Commit message."
    
Where "Commit message." is a single short sentence describing why you are committing
in quotes. After this all of your changes are saved locally by Git, you should
make sure to commit often so that you can roll back any changes that messed things up.


-----PUSHING CHANGES YOU'VE MADE TO THE PROJECT ON GITHUB-----
In order to push any changes you've made first do this:

    git push origin master

enter your github username and password when prompted, and you're done!
